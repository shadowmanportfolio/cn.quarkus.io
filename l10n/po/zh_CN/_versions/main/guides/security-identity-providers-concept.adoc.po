msgid "In the Quarkus Security framework, identity providers play a key role in authentication and authorization, providing services for storing and verifying user identities.  The JPA `IdentityProvider` creates a `SecurityIdentity` instance used during user authentication to verify and authorize access requests, making your Quarkus application secure."
