If you're using Podman with Quarkus, some one-off setup is needed, but once it's done, you can take advantage of all the Quarkus features."

Therefore, the containers must run in a Linux virtual machine (VM), and a Podman client interacts with that VM.  A native hypervisor subsystem and virtualization software is used to run the Linux VM on the OS, and then containers are run within this VM.  In Podman, this is known as the Podman machine, and it is built into the tool."

msgid "Podman supports two modes of operation: rootful, in which case the container runs as root on the host system, and rootless, where the container runs under a standard Unix user account.  On Linux, the REST API Unix socket is, by default, restricted to only allow the root user to access it.  This prevents someone from using a container to achieve a privilege escalation on the syetem.  While these restrictions can be softened to allow a special group instead of just root, the recommended approach is to use rootless Podman on Linux.  To use rootless Podman, you need to set a DOCKER_HOST environment variable to point to the user-specific socket.  In both cases, you need to start the REST API by enabling the Podman socket service through systemd."
