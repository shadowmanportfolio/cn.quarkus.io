msgid "If proactive authentication is in use, accessing the `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation.  This is because authentication may have yet to happen, and accessing it may require calls to external systems, such as databases that may block.  For blocking applications, this is no problem. However, if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application, this will fail (as you cannot do blocking operations on the IO thread).  To work around this, you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method.  You can then subscribe to the resulting `Uni` and will be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."

The same is also valid for the xref:reactive-routes.adoc[Reactive routes] if a route response is synchronous."

msgid "Some HTTP authentication mechanisms need to handle authentication exceptions themselves to create a correct authentication challenge.  For example, `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.CodeAuthenticationMechanism` which manages OpenId Connect authorization code flow authentication, needs to build a correct redirect URL, cookies, etc.  For that reason, using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms is not recommended.  Instead, a safer approach would be to ensure that proactive authentication is enabled and to use Vert.x HTTP route failure handlers. This is because events come to the handler with the correct response status and headers.  You will then only need to customize the response, as outlined in the following example:"
